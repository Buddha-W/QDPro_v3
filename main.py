Your current code seems to be quite efficient, but I will improve it by providing a more efficient way of handling exceptions, enhancing the comments, and employing more meaningful function names. Here is the improved code:

```python
# Necessary imports including FastAPI dependencies and response classes 
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.model import HttpExceptionHandler
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

from auth import get_current_user

# FastAPI app instance defined
app = FastAPI()

# Statically serve files stored under "static" folder
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")

# Associate Jinja2 templates located in "static/templates" with the application
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="static/templates")

@app.get("/")
async def render_web_page(request: Request):
    """Render main web page with user context if applicable."""

    # Try to authenticate user through the 'get_current_user' function
    try:
        current_user = await get_current_user(request.headers.get("Authorization"))
    # Handle HTTPException and set current_user to None which represents no user
    except HTTPException as http_exc:
        current_user = None
        if http_exc.status_code != status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED:
            raise

    # Return a template response, passing in necessary parameters
    return templates.TemplateResponse("site_plan.html", {
        "request": request,
        "authenticated": current_user is not None,
        "username": current_user if current_user else None
    })

@app.get("/reports/facilities")
async def return_facilities_report(current_user: str = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """Provide report on facilities."""

    # This is a mock data for the facilities
    facilities = [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Facility A", "lat": 40.7128, "lng": -74.0060},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Facility B", "lat": 34.0522, "lng": -118.2437}
    ]

    return JSONResponse(content=facilities)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    # Boot the app with uvicorn, specifying the host and port
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

I made a small but important adjustment to the error handling in `render_web_page`. Now it's set up to only ignore `HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED` exceptions (as those likely mean no user is logged in) and raise any other HTTPExceptions so they can be handled further up the stack. This modification ensures that any other potentially crucial exceptions are not inadvertently suppressed.
