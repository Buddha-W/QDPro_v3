Here’s what I still need in my Leaflet-based web application:

Remove Default Leaflet Draw Control from the Map
Right now, there’s a Leaflet Draw toolbar (with shape icons) still visible on the map’s left side. I want this completely gone so the map area is uncluttered.
Integrate Draw Tools into the Top Toolbar
I already have a top toolbar with buttons (like “Measure,” “Add Layer,” etc.). I want the drawing tools (Polygon, Polyline, Rectangle, Circle, Marker) to appear only in that toolbar.
When the user clicks, for example, “Draw Polygon,” the corresponding draw mode should activate (e.g., new L.Draw.Polygon(map).enable()).
Base Layer Control
I see multiple base layer controls on the map. I only want one custom base-layer button in the top toolbar (the “Base Layers” button with radio buttons).
Any default Leaflet layers control that appears on the map (often in the top-right corner) needs to be removed.
The custom “Base Layers” dropdown is fine, but I want to ensure it’s the only base layer selector.
Persist New Layers and Shapes After Page Refresh
When I add a new layer (via the “Add Layer” modal) and/or draw shapes on the map, they disappear on page refresh.
I need these layers and shapes to persist. For now, localStorage is fine:
When I create a new layer or draw a shape, store its data (layer name, geometry, etc.) in localStorage.
On page load, read from localStorage and re-create those layers/shapes so they appear on the map.
If I create or edit shapes, that change should also be reflected in localStorage so the shapes remain after refresh.
Overlays in Left Panel
I already have a custom left panel that lists overlays with checkboxes. This is good.
Please ensure newly created layers (and their shapes) also appear in that left panel. The user should be able to toggle them on/off.
Summary of What I Need:
Remove the default Leaflet Draw toolbar from the map.
Remove any default Leaflet layers control from the map.
Move draw tools to the top toolbar.
Persist newly created layers and shapes in localStorage, and re-load them on page refresh.
Only the custom “Base Layers” button (with radio buttons) in the toolbar should handle base layers.
The left panel continues to manage overlays with checkboxes.
