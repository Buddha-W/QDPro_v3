Hi, I need help diagnosing and improving my automated explosive site planning tool (QDPro) project. Here are the key details:
Project Overview:
Backend: Built with Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy. It includes API endpoints such as /api/facilities for facility data and /api/qd/<facility_id> for QD distance calculations.
Frontend: Uses HTML/JavaScript with Leaflet for interactive mapping. The map loads facility data and displays QD safety zones.
Additional Features: The project includes modules for generating risk assessment PDFs, transmittal letters, and submittal packages using ReportLab and Folium.
Project Structure:
/templates: Contains HTML files (e.g., index.html, risk_assessment_edit.html).
/static: Holds JavaScript, CSS, and any other frontend assets.
app.py (or main.py): The main Flask application entry point.
requirements.txt: Contains all dependencies.
.replit: (If available) Contains the configuration for launching the project.
requirements.txt (Cleaned Up):
flask
flask-sqlalchemy
jinja2
folium
reportlab
pandas
geopandas
sqlalchemy
psycopg2-binary
geoalchemy2
shapely
pdfkit
plotly
scikit-learn
numpy
psutil
python-jose[cryptography]
passlib[bcrypt]
python-multipart
pyjwt
pyotp
qrcode
pillow
alembic
Issues and Questions:
The map loads and some API endpoints work, but Iâ€™m not sure if my project is set up optimally.
I need to verify that the frontend and backend are properly connected, and that the API endpoints (e.g., for QD calculations) are robust and efficient.
I also want to ensure that the PDF generation (risk assessment, transmittal letter, submittal package) works correctly on Replit.
Are there any improvements you can suggest for my project structure or code organization to better support future enhancements (e.g., interactive mapping, improved error handling, scalability)?
Could you review the above details, verify the environment setup based on the requirements.txt, and provide specific recommendations or debugging steps to optimize the project on Replit?
Thanks!
