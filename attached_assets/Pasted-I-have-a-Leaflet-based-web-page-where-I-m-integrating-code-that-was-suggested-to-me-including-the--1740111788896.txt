I have a Leaflet-based web page where I’m integrating code that was suggested to me (including the <!DOCTYPE html> snippet with the .base-layer-option and .panel-header styles). However, I’m worried about possible conflicts or missing elements. Could you please:

Merge the Suggested Code Without Duplicates
Make sure I have only one set of <script> and <link> tags for Leaflet and Leaflet Draw, removing any duplicates.
If there are multiple <script> blocks with DOMContentLoaded events, please consolidate them into one block so they don’t overwrite each other.
Ensure Matching Element IDs
The code references IDs like baseLayerDropdown, toggleLayersPanel, leftPanel, etc. Please confirm that the HTML elements with those IDs actually exist.
If any are missing, create them. If any are unused, remove the references.
Order of Execution
Ensure the map initialization script (and any related code) runs after the DOM is loaded, or place it at the bottom of the <body>.
Verify that the code that manipulates the toolbar buttons (e.g., “Draw Polygon,” “Draw Polyline”) only runs after those elements exist in the DOM.
Left Panel Toggle
The code may use panel.classList.toggle('visible') or adjust CSS with marginLeft to open/close the panel. Whichever approach is used, make sure it matches the actual CSS.
For example, if .left-panel.visible { transform: translateX(0); } is in the CSS, then toggling .visible is correct. If the code is using marginLeft = '-300px', ensure the CSS isn’t also using transforms.
Make sure the panel’s label (“Layers Panel”) and content (e.g., the overlay checkboxes) appear correctly when opened.
Base Layer Dropdown
The code sets #baseLayerDropdown with position: absolute; z-index: 1000;. Make sure it’s not clipped by any parent container with overflow: hidden or a mismatched position.
The dropdown should appear directly under the “Base Layers” button. If it’s cut off or in the wrong place, adjust the CSS (e.g., set top and left based on the button’s position).
Shape Drawing Buttons
I need separate buttons for “Draw Polygon,” “Draw Polyline,” “Draw Rectangle,” “Draw Circle,” and “Draw Marker.” Each should call the correct Leaflet Draw constructor (e.g., new L.Draw.Polygon(map).enable()).
Ensure these buttons actually exist in the toolbar HTML, and that the code references the correct IDs (e.g., drawPolygon, drawPolyline, etc.).
Remove any references to the default Leaflet Draw toolbar if I only want a custom toolbar.
No Default Leaflet Layers Control
I don’t want the default Leaflet control that shows checkboxes for base layers. If it’s still appearing, remove the call to L.control.layers(...) or pass an empty object for overlays.
Final Integration
After making these changes, the left panel should toggle properly, the base layer dropdown should appear under its button, the shape drawing buttons should work, and there should be no duplicate scripts or references.
Could you please provide a revised version of my code (or instructions) that meets all these requirements? Thank you!
