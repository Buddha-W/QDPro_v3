I’m having several problems with my Leaflet-based web application. Here are the key issues:

Toggle Layers Panel Not Working
The “Toggle Layers Panel” button (with id toggleLayersPanel) is supposed to show/hide the left panel (#leftPanel), but it doesn’t actually toggle correctly. I need it to reliably open and close that panel.
Shape Drawing Tools Not in the Top Toolbar
I want my Polygon, Polyline, Rectangle, Circle, and Marker drawing tools in the top toolbar, so when the user clicks a button, it activates the corresponding draw mode (e.g., new L.Draw.Polygon(map).enable()), rather than relying on the default Leaflet Draw toolbar on the map.
Base Layers Button Not Working with Radio Buttons
I have a “Base Layers” button (#baseLayerTool) in the top toolbar, but it doesn’t correctly show radio buttons for each base layer. Also, selecting a radio button should switch the map to that base layer and close the dropdown.
I also want to remove the default Leaflet layers control entirely, so the only way to switch base layers is through my custom “Base Layers” button in the toolbar.
Remove Default Leaflet Draw Control
The default Leaflet Draw control still appears on the map (or is partially active). I want it removed so the map is uncluttered, relying only on my custom toolbar for drawing.
Please fix these issues in my code so that:

Toggle Layers Panel: The button with id="toggleLayersPanel" opens and closes the left panel reliably, resizing the map accordingly.
Top Toolbar Drawing Tools: The top toolbar has working buttons for Polygon, Polyline, Rectangle, Circle, and Marker, each enabling the correct draw mode when clicked.
Base Layers Button: The “Base Layers” button in the toolbar shows radio buttons for OpenStreetMap, Google Satellite, Google Streets, and Google Hybrid. Selecting one switches the map’s base layer and closes the dropdown.
No Default Controls: Remove/hide the default Leaflet layers control and the default Leaflet Draw toolbar from the map area so they don’t clutter the interface.
