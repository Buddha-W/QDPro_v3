I have a FastAPI project with site_plan.html that uses a File menu with modal pop-ups to create and switch locations. I need to make further updates to my project:

1. **New Location Blank Slate:**  
   When switching to a new location using the "Switch to New Location" option after creating a new location, the current layers should remain defined but all drawn shapes (features) should be cleared. In other words, the new location should have a blank slate for drawing new shapes.

2. **Shape Styling Based on Type:**  
   When new shapes are added:
   - If the shape is of type "PES," the shape should be styled with a red fill and a red outline.
   - If the shape is of type "ES," the shape should be styled with a green fill and a green outline.
   - (Assume that the type can be determined from a property in the shapeâ€™s feature, for example, feature.properties.type.)  
   Update the drawing logic in the JavaScript code so that when shapes are added to the map, they are rendered with the appropriate styles based on their type.

3. **Toolbar Improvements:**  
   Update the tool toolbar to have a layout and style similar to ArcGIS or ESS when adding shapes. This may include:  
   - Rearranging buttons to group drawing tools in a visually appealing way.  
   - Adding icons or labels that match a modern, professional GIS tool look.  
   - Ensuring that the toolbar is intuitive and does not interfere with the map view.

Please update my existing project accordingly. Provide complete, updated code snippets (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript parts from site_plan.html and any related JS files) so that:
- When switching to a new location, the layers remain defined but any drawn features are cleared (blank slate).
- New shapes are styled with red fill/outline if they are "PES" and green fill/outline if they are "ES".
- The toolbar layout is improved to look more like ArcGIS/ESS.

Below is my current site_plan.html code (with menus, modals, toolbar, and map JavaScript). Please update and return the full modified code:

[Insert your current site_plan.html code here with the File menu, modals, toolbar, and drawing JavaScript]

Please return the full updated code that implements these new features.
