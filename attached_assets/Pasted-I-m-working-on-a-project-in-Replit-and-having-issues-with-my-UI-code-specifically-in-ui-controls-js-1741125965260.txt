I’m working on a project in Replit and having issues with my UI code, specifically in ui-controls.js or related files. I need help fixing the following console errors and implementing a function to open an internal database (within the current project’s data structure). Here are the errors I’m seeing:

    [Error] ReferenceError: Can't find variable: activateTool
        Location: Global Code (ui-controls.js:743)
        I think this happens because activateTool isn’t defined or is out of scope when called.
    [Error] SyntaxError: Can't create duplicate variable: 'map'
        This suggests I’ve accidentally declared let map or const map more than once in the same scope.
    [Error] SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'
        Location: (anonymous function) (fa4f7762-7ea0-4b1c-9dae-803dcd2b3e82-00-18krt1dggw9sn.spock.replit.dev:1005)
        I likely have an extra or misplaced closing parenthesis ).

What I need:

    Fix these errors in my code so the UI works without crashing.
    Add a working activateTool() function that opens an internal database (e.g., an in-memory object like { records: [] } if no real database is set up yet). This should initialize the database if it’s not already open and log a message to the console like "Database opened."
    Ensure the fixes align with my existing code in ui-controls.js or other relevant files.

Instructions:

    For the ReferenceError:
        Check ui-controls.js around line 743 for where activateTool is called.
        If it’s undefined, define it as a function (e.g., function activateTool() { ... }) in the global scope or where it’s accessible.
        If it’s defined elsewhere, ensure it’s in the right scope or fix the call.
    For the duplicate 'map' variable:
        Search my code for multiple let map or const map declarations in the same scope.
        Remove duplicates by keeping only the first declaration and using assignment (e.g., map = newValue) for later updates.
        If map conflicts with something like Array.map, rename my variable (e.g., myMap).
    For the unexpected token ')'':
        Look around line 1005 in the file (or nearby in ui-controls.js) for a syntax error with parentheses.
        Fix any mismatched or extra ) characters (e.g., change someFunction()) to someFunction()).
    Add the database function:
        Implement activateTool() to manage an internal database. Example:
        javascript

        let database = null;
        function activateTool() {
          if (!database) {
            database = { records: [] };
            console.log("Database opened.");
          } else {
            console.log("Database already open.");
          }
          return database;
        }
        Integrate this into my UI logic so it runs when needed (e.g., on a button click).

Please locate these issues in my project files, apply the fixes, and test that the UI runs without errors. Let me know what changes you make and where, so I can understand the solution. Thanks!
