my map (possibly a UI map component or data structure) is not loading after some recent changes. I’m seeing the following errors in the console, which I need help fixing:

    [Error] SyntaxError: Can't create duplicate variable: 'map'
        This suggests I’ve declared let map or const map more than once in the same scope, causing a conflict.
    [Error] SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'
        Location: (anonymous function) (fa4f7762-7ea0-4b1c-9dae-803dcd2b3e82-00-18krt1dggw9sn.spock.replit.dev:1005)
        This indicates a syntax error with an extra or misplaced closing parenthesis ) around line 1005 in my code.

Context:

    I think the map variable might be related to a map component in my UI (e.g., a mapping library like Leaflet or Google Maps) or a data structure I’m using, but it’s not working because of these errors.
    The file causing the issue is likely dynamically generated (fa4f7762-...), but it could be tied to my main JavaScript file (e.g., ui-controls.js or similar).

What I need:

    Fix the duplicate map variable issue so there’s only one declaration, and the map loads correctly.
    Correct the syntax error with the unexpected ) so the code parses properly.
    Ensure the map (whether it’s a UI element or data structure) works after the fixes.

Instructions:

    Fix the duplicate 'map' variable:
        Search my project files (e.g., ui-controls.js or other JS files) for all instances of let map or const map.
        If there are multiple declarations in the same scope, keep only the first one and replace later declarations with assignments (e.g., change let map = newValue to map = newValue).
        If map is a UI map (e.g., from a library), ensure it’s initialized only once, like:
        javascript

        let map; // Declare once
        function initMap() {
          if (!map) {
            map = L.map('mapDiv'); // Example for Leaflet; adjust for your library
            console.log("Map initialized.");
          }
        }
        If it conflicts with something like Array.map, rename my variable (e.g., myMap).
    Fix the unexpected token ')'':
        Locate line 1005 in the problematic file (check ui-controls.js or related scripts if it’s not clear).
        Look for a syntax error with parentheses, such as an extra ) or a missing (. Examples:
            Wrong: someFunction())
            Correct: someFunction()
        Check the surrounding lines (e.g., 1004–1006) for incomplete statements or mismatched brackets/parentheses, and fix them.
    Test the map:
        After fixing these errors, ensure the map loads in the UI (e.g., a visible map component) or functions as intended (if it’s a data structure).
        Add a console log to confirm it’s working, like console.log("Map loaded successfully");.

Please find and edit the relevant files in my project to resolve these errors. Test the changes to confirm the map loads without crashing, and let me know what you changed and where (e.g., file name and line numbers) so I can follow along. Thanks!
