Ensuring the map loads automatically, which may be due to CSS or rendering issues. The map container needs a specified height and width, such as <div id="map" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>, and initialization with var map = L.map('map').setView([39.8283, -98.5795], 4); followed by adding a tile layer like L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', { attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' }).addTo(map);. This ensures the map renders on page load without requiring user interaction.
Setting up the drawing control correctly, creating a feature group for drawn items, such as var drawnItems = L.featureGroup().addTo(map);, and initializing the draw control with options for various shapes, then adding it to the map: var drawControl = new L.control.Draw({ draw: { polygon: true, polyline: true, rectangle: true, circle: true, marker: true }, edit: { featureGroup: drawnItems, edit: true, remove: true } }).addTo(map);. Handling the draw:created event ensures layers are added to the feature group: map.on('draw:created', function(e) { drawnItems.addLayer(e.layer); });.
Checking the browser console for JavaScript errors, which may indicate compatibility issues or misconfigurations, and verifying compatibility between Leaflet and Leaflet.draw versions, as mismatches can cause functionality issues. Documentation from Leaflet Draw GitHub highlights common setup errors.
Ensuring drawing mode activation, particularly if using custom buttons, by correctly linking them to activate specific modes, such as document.getElementById('draw-polygon-button').addEventListener('click', function() { drawControl._toolbars.draw._modes.poly._activate(); });. This addresses issues where buttons do not activate the correct drawing mode.
Finalizing polygon drawing, where double-clicking should close the shape. If vertex markers remain, ensure the draw:created event is properly handling the addition of the layer and that no custom code interferes with the default behavior, ensuring shapes are finalized without leaving markers.
