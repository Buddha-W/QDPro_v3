When the map doesn't load, it can be due to a variety of issues—missing libraries, syntax errors, or issues in the initialization code. Here’s a checklist and some steps to help you debug:

Check the Browser Console:
Open your browser’s developer console and look for any errors or warnings. Errors like “L is not defined” or “Uncaught SyntaxError” can point to missing libraries or syntax issues.
Verify Library Inclusions:
Ensure that your Leaflet CSS and JS files are loaded correctly in your HTML. For example, confirm you have tags like:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
If you’re using Leaflet.draw, make sure its CSS and JS are also loaded.
Map Container:
Confirm that the HTML element for the map (typically a <div> with an id like map) exists, has a set height (e.g., via CSS), and is visible. If the map div has zero height, nothing will be displayed.
Initialization Code:
Verify your JavaScript code that initializes the map. For a simple test, try something like:
var map = L.map('map').setView([40.7128, -74.0060], 13);
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
}).addTo(map);
If this basic example works, then the issue might be in your added modifications.
Syntax Errors:
If there are syntax errors preventing JavaScript from running, the map won’t load. Check that all your brackets, semicolons, and quotes are correctly placed. Replit’s console should help identify exactly where the error is.
Order of Script Execution:
Make sure that your scripts run after the DOM is loaded. You can wrap your map initialization code in:
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    // Your map initialization code here
});
Network Issues:
Occasionally, if the external libraries aren’t loading (e.g., due to network issues or a misconfigured proxy in Replit), the map won’t show. Confirm that you can access the URLs for Leaflet and Leaflet.draw from your browser.
