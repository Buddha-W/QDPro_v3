I'm building an explosive safety siting web application called QDPro. It should allow users to draw facility polygons on a map (using Leaflet and Leaflet.draw), select a database layer (via a “Draw to Layer” dropdown), and save/load these drawings via backend endpoints (like /api/save-layers and /api/load-layers). However, nothing is working correctly—my map is not loading, and none of the functionality (drawing, layer management, toolbars, modals, etc.) seems to work as intended. I have been working on this for weeks and am going in circles.

Below are the contents of my site_plan.html and qdpro.js files (both have been uploaded). Please review these files and provide a complete, no-flaw fix to address the following issues:

Map Initialization:
The map is not loading at all. The qdpro.js file attempts to initialize the map (or use an existing one) but nothing appears.
Ensure that the map container (with id "map") is properly sized and that the Leaflet map is initialized only once and referenced correctly throughout the code.
Event Handling & Drawing:
The draw:created event isn’t firing as expected. When a user draws a facility polygon, it should be added to the currently active layer (selected via the “Draw to Layer” dropdown) and then saved to the database.
Fix any issues related to how the active layer is updated or how drawn polygons are added (including auto-closing the polygon).
Layer Management:
The “Draw to Layer” dropdown is not updating the global activeLayer correctly. New drawings are not being assigned to the selected database layer.
Ensure that when a user selects a new layer from the dropdown, the activeLayer is updated so that subsequent drawn features are added to that layer.
UI & Modal Issues:
Some modal functions (for adding layers, switching locations, and creating new locations) are missing or not working.
Ensure that the top navigation bar (File, Edit, View, Tools, Help) remains on one row and is fully visible, with dropdowns appearing on top of other elements.
Debugging & Logging:
Add clear console logs at key steps (map initialization, event bindings, layer selection, drawing creation, saving, and loading) so I can see in the browser console what’s happening.
Please fix the code (both HTML and JS in qdpro.js) so that:

The map is properly loaded and sized.
Drawing events work correctly, adding drawn polygons to the active layer and saving them.
The active layer updates correctly when the user selects a different layer.
All UI components (navigation bar, toolbars, left panel, modals) function without overlap or z-index issues.
Include explanations for your key changes and how they address these issues. Thank you!
