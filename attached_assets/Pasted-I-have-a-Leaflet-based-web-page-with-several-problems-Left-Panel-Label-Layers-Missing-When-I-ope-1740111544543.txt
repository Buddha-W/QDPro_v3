I have a Leaflet-based web page with several problems:

Left Panel Label & Layers Missing
When I open the layers panel, the title "Layers Panel" is gone or hidden, and I don’t see my list of overlays or the “Draw to” dropdown. I need the left panel to clearly show the label “Layers Panel” at the top and list my overlays (e.g., “Drawn Items,” “Facilities,” “Analysis,” plus any new layers I add).
Top Toolbar Buttons Not Working
None of the buttons in the top toolbar (e.g., “Measure,” “Add Layer,” “Base Layers,” etc.) are functioning. When I click them, nothing happens. I need each button to do what it’s supposed to do:
Toggle Layers Panel (toggleLayersPanel): open/close the left panel properly.
Add Layer (addLayerTool): open the modal to add a new layer.
Base Layers (baseLayerTool): show a dropdown or popover with radio buttons for each base layer, positioned directly below the button.
Shape Drawing Buttons: I also need separate buttons for drawing Polygon, Polyline, Rectangle, Circle, and Marker in the top toolbar. Clicking one should enable the corresponding draw mode (e.g., new L.Draw.Polygon(map).enable()).
Base Layer Button / Radio Buttons Partially Hidden
The dropdown for choosing base layers is not positioned correctly or is cut off. I need it to appear right below the “Base Layers” button in the toolbar, large enough to show all the radio buttons (OpenStreetMap, Google Satellite, Google Streets, Google Hybrid).
No Visible “Draw Polygon” etc. Buttons
I see code referencing drawPolygon, drawPolyline, etc., but I don’t actually see any buttons in the toolbar for these shapes. I want 5 buttons in the toolbar: “Draw Polygon,” “Draw Polyline,” “Draw Rectangle,” “Draw Circle,” and “Draw Marker.” Each button should enable the correct draw tool on click.
Consolidate or Remove Conflicting DOMContentLoaded Scripts
It looks like there are multiple DOMContentLoaded event listeners, and some code might be overwriting other code or not running at the right time. I need a single, unified script block (or carefully organized code) so everything initializes in the correct order.
Keep Existing Features
The left panel overlay checkboxes should still toggle each layer on/off.
The “Add Layer” modal should still allow me to create a new layer (and optionally draw shapes on it).
The “toggleLayersPanel” button should still hide/show the left panel, adjusting the map size accordingly.
If you can, please ensure shapes remain after refresh (using localStorage or the existing logic).
Please fix these issues in my code so that:

The left panel shows the label “Layers Panel” and the overlays.
The top toolbar buttons each perform their intended function.
The base layers dropdown appears correctly under the “Base Layers” button.
There are visible buttons for drawing polygons, polylines, rectangles, circles, and markers in the top toolbar.
Any conflicting scripts or duplicated DOMContentLoaded blocks are merged or removed so initialization works smoothly.
