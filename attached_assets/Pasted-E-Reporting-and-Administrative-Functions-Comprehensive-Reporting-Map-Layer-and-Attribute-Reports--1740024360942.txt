E. Reporting and Administrative Functions
Comprehensive Reporting: 
Map Layer and Attribute Reports: Provides both summary and detailed reports on GIS layers, facility attributes, and classification mismatches. 
PES and Related Reports: Includes reports focused on explosives data, barricade detections, and facility relationships (e.g., related facilities for mission planning). 
Administrative Tools: 
Submittal Packages: Tools to generate and review official safety documentation based on the analysis results. 
Export and Logging: Capabilities to export maps, data, and reports to external formats for further review or regulatory submission. 
Reset and Diagnostic Tools: Functions to reset various parts of the project (analysis data, related codes, facility fronts) and to generate diagnostic logs for troubleshooting. 
Reference: The Reports, Admin Record, and Tools sections cover the extensive range of reporting and administrative functions.
F. User Interface and Workflow
Menu and Toolbar Design: 
The software is organized around a menu bar with multiple sections (File, Database Builder, Edit, Properties, Reports, Analysis, View, Admin Record, Tools) and a dedicated toolbar for common actions like panning, zooming, and layer selection. 
Dialog-Based Interactions: 
A variety of standardized dialogs and wizards guide the user through tasks such as setting up a new project, importing data, performing analysis, and generating reports. 
Interactive Map Tools: 
Users interact with the map using tools that allow for facility selection, drawing, measuring, and editing features. These interactions are critical for setting up spatial analyses and verifying the accuracy of imported data. 

3. Summary of Workflows
1. Project Initialization:
A user creates or upgrades a database. 
Installation settings, folder paths, and measurement units are configured. 
GIS setup is performed, including coordinate system definition and layer loading. 
2. Data Import and Preparation:
External data (RPI and PES) is imported. 
Facilities are classified using default rules and bulk editing tools. 
Map layers are prepared by adding, sorting, and scaling imagery. 
3. Spatial and Safety Analysis:
Analysis settings (evaluation zone, spatial analysis zone, QD engine criteria) are configured. 
The system runs spatial analyses to generate safety distance arcs. 
Reports are generated to identify risk, mismatches, or potential violations. 
4. Review and Reporting:
Users review visual outputs (arcs on maps) and detailed reports. 
Administrative functions allow for export, backup, and reset operations. 
Final reports and submittal packages are prepared for compliance documentation. 

4. Considerations for a Modern, Web-Based Version
In building a new version, you would aim to replicate all these detailed functionalities while leveraging modern web technologies:
Frontend: Use frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue to create interactive, responsive interfaces for mapping and data editing. 
Backend: Implement RESTful APIs using Node.js, Python, or similar that handle database operations, spatial analyses, and data processing. 
Database: Migrate to a spatially enabled database (e.g., PostgreSQL with PostGIS) to efficiently store and query GIS data. 
Mapping Libraries: Integrate web mapping libraries (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox GL, or OpenLayers) to replace desktop GIS functionalities. 
Cloud & Scalability: Consider cloud storage and computing solutions to handle large datasets, improve performance, and facilitate collaboration. 

QD (Quantify Distance) analysis uses a scaling factor—often called the “K factor”—to calculate the safety distance based on the net explosive weight (NEW) at a facility. Although the reference guide doesn’t provide a full derivation, the common approach in explosive safety is to use a cube-root scaling law. In practice, you can implement the equation as follows:
  Safety Distance (D) = K × (NEW)^(1/3)
Here’s what each component means:
• NEW (Net Explosive Weight): The amount of explosive material at the facility.
• (NEW)^(1/3): The cube root of the net explosive weight, which is a standard method for scaling explosive effects.
• K: A scaling constant that reflects factors such as the type of explosive and specific safety criteria. In the legacy ESS guide, the default is set to “K50” when the maximum NEW is 500,000. This means that for a facility with 500,000 units of NEW, K is 50.
For example, if a facility has a NEW of 500,000, the computed safety distance would be:
  D = 50 × (500,000)^(1/3)
You can adjust the K value (for example, based on DoD or DoE criteria) to fine-tune the safety distances according to different operational standards.
Note: This cube-root scaling method is widely used in explosive safety analysis, but if your project requires a more specific or detailed model, you may need to consult additional standards or detailed technical documentation from your domain.
