Here are the changes I need in my Leaflet-based web app:

Remove the Default Layer Control on the Map
Currently, I see a “stack button” (the default Leaflet control) on the right side of the map with checkboxes for base layers (OpenStreetMap, Google Satellite, etc.).
I want this completely gone to maximize map viewing space—no default Leaflet layers control visible in the map area.
Custom “Base Layers” Button in the Top Toolbar
In the top toolbar (where my other tools live), I want a button labeled “Base Layers.”
Clicking this button should open a small dropdown or popover containing radio buttons for each base layer (OpenStreetMap, Google Satellite, Google Streets, Google Hybrid, etc.).
Only one base layer can be active at a time, so radio buttons are ideal.
When the user selects a radio button, switch the map to that base layer.
This means I do not call L.control.layers(baseLayers, ...) on the map. Instead, I manually switch layers when a user picks one from the radio list.
Move Leaflet Draw Tools to the Top Toolbar
Right now, Leaflet Draw typically puts its own toolbar on the left side of the map. I want to remove that and have the drawing tools integrated into my top toolbar instead.
For example, I might have buttons for “Draw Polygon,” “Draw Polyline,” “Draw Rectangle,” “Draw Circle,” etc. in the toolbar.
When the user clicks one of these buttons, the corresponding draw mode should activate (e.g., new L.Draw.Polygon(map).enable()), allowing them to draw that shape on the map.
Add Shapes to a Specific Layer
I have multiple overlay layers (e.g., “Drawn Items,” “Facilities,” “Analysis,” etc.). I want the user to choose which layer they’re drawing to (maybe via a dropdown or radio buttons in the toolbar).
When they finish drawing, the shape should be added to that chosen layer’s FeatureGroup.
The “draw:created” event listener should check which layer the user selected, then add the newly created shape to that layer.
Example logic:
map.on('draw:created', function(e) {
  const layer = e.layer;
  const chosenLayer = /* whichever layer the user selected */;
  chosenLayer.addLayer(layer);
});
No Changes to My Left Panel Overlays
I already have a custom left panel listing my overlays (Drawn Items, Facilities, Analysis, etc.). That’s good. I just need to ensure newly drawn shapes go to whichever layer is selected in the top toolbar.
The left panel’s checkboxes should still toggle overlay visibility.
I do not want these overlays or their checkboxes in the on-map control (which is being removed).
Summary of Requirements:

Remove the default Leaflet control entirely (so the stack button on the right disappears).
Add a “Base Layers” button in the top toolbar that opens a dropdown/popover with radio buttons for each base layer.
Move all drawing tools to the top toolbar (no Leaflet Draw toolbar on the left).
Allow the user to select which overlay layer (Drawn Items, Facilities, etc.) the newly drawn shapes should be added to.
Keep my left panel overlays as is for toggling visibility.
Could you please update my code to achieve this?
